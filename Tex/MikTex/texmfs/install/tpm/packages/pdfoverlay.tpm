This might arise if you wish to add comments to a PDF, fill in a PDF form, or add text to a PDF where space has been left for notes. This package provides a simple interface to do this without having to resort to inserting one page at a time. Some or all of the pages of the PDF can be included and not all pages of the PDF need have overlayed text. It is also possible to include text between pages of the PDF. Another advantage of this package is that the overlayed text can be set as normal flowing from one page to another or with manual page breaks if you wish. It is also possible to use any standard method to position text at arbitrary places on a given page. This package depends on xparse, everypage, and pdfpages.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="1794">texmf\tpm\packages\pdfoverlay.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="546619">texmf\doc\latex\pdfoverlay\pdfoverlay.pdf texmf\doc\latex\pdfoverlay\README.md</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="5092">texmf\source\pdfoverlay-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1526069524</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>6a0da0990dc5f748462d60d86b53b327</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/pdfoverlay"/><TPM:Copyright owner="David Purton" year="2018"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3c"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
