They allow you to easily highlight text and add comments in the margin. Vim escape sequences are provided for inserting or removing these LaTeX commands in the source. Options are provided for displaying the document with extra line spacing, and for displaying it in either corrected or uncorrected state, both without margin notes. The package is based on code for a text highlighting command that was published by Antal Spector-Zabusky on http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/5959. The main file, proofread.dtx, is self-extracting, so you can generate the style file by compiling proofread.dtx with pdfLaTeX. This package is based on the soul package; so if you plan to highlight non-ASCII characters, you must compile your source with either XeTeX- or LuaTeX-based compilers.</TPM:Description><TPM:RunFiles size="7613">texmf\tex\latex\proofread\proofread.sty texmf\tpm\packages\proofread.tpm</TPM:RunFiles><TPM:DocFiles size="275828">texmf\doc\latex\proofread\example.pdf texmf\doc\latex\proofread\proofread.pdf texmf\doc\latex\proofread\README texmf\doc\latex\proofread\README.txt</TPM:DocFiles><TPM:SourceFiles size="20532">texmf\source\proofread-src.tar.xz</TPM:SourceFiles><TPM:TimePackaged>1533240721</TPM:TimePackaged><TPM:MD5>ed0db7b85c7d662e5dd003a71ca223e6</TPM:MD5><TPM:CTAN path="/macros/latex/contrib/proofread"/><TPM:Copyright owner="Wybo Dekker" year="2017"/><TPM:License type="lppl1.3c"/></rdf:Description></rdf:RDF>
